# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

In this assignment, we will use Python to buid and evaluate different machine learning models to precict crect risk.

We will use the following procedures:
1. Oversample the data using Ramdom Over Sampler and SMOTE algorithms
2. Undersample the data using Cluster Centroids algorithm
3. Use a combinational approach over and undersampling using SMOTE-ENN algorithm
4. Compare two machine learning models that reduce biases i.e. Balanced Ramdom Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemple CLassifier

We will evaluate the performance of these models and make recomendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.


## Results 

We will show the Balanced Accuracy Scores, Confusion Matrix and Imbalanced Classifiers for each model.
